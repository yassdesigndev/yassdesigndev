👋 Hi, I’m Yara, a passionate product designer.

🤓 I enjoy learning code because it helps me communicate better with engineering teams, spot challenges and limitations early, and uncover new opportunities — all while designing better products and services.

✨ I’m excited about the potential of AI to transform our lives for the better.

🌱 I’ve created an app of my own, and I’ve made it open source so we can build it together.

⚡ I mentor startups, and I volunteer for transformative causes and organisations that are creating positive change in our communities through design.

💞️ Let’s connect and collaborate!
